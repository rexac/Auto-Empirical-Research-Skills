# AERS Benchmark

A small, **reproducible, dependency-free** benchmark of empirical-research agent
behavior. Where [`eval-harness/`](../eval-harness/) checks *properties of an agent's prose*,
the benchmark checks *numbers*: given a real dataset with a known answer, does
the pipeline recover it — and does it avoid the trap a naive pipeline falls into?

## Task: `lalonde-recovery`

The LaLonde (1986) / Dehejia–Wahba (1999) data is the canonical observational
causal-inference stress test, already vendored in this repo at
[`demo-notebooks/_lalonde_data.csv`](../demo-notebooks/_lalonde_data.csv)
(185 treated from the NSW experiment, 429 non-experimental CPS controls).

The lesson the benchmark encodes, all reproducible from the data:

| Quantity | Value | Meaning |
|---|---:|---|
| Naive ATT on `re78` | **−$635** | Treated earn *less* than the mismatched CPS controls — the naive comparison misleads. |
| Covariates with \|SMD\| > 0.25 | **5 of 8** | Severe pre-treatment imbalance (black, married, re74, re75, hispan). |
| Regression-adjusted ATT | **+$1,548** | Conditioning on pre-period earnings flips the sign to positive. |
| Experimental benchmark | **≈ +$1,794** | Dehejia–Wahba (1999), from the original randomized NSW experiment. |

A pipeline that handles this correctly **surfaces the imbalance**, **does not
report −$635 as the causal effect**, and after adjustment **recovers a positive
estimate near the experimental benchmark**.

## Task: `card-iv-recovery`

Card (1995) instruments years of schooling with proximity to a 4-year college
(`nearc4`), data vendored at
[`demo-StatsPAI-skill/data/card.csv`](../demo-StatsPAI-skill/data/card.csv)
(3,010 observations). All values reproducible from the data:

| Quantity | Value | Meaning |
|---|---:|---|
| OLS return to schooling | **0.075** | Naive OLS estimate of the wage return. |
| IV return to schooling | **0.131** | 2SLS with `nearc4` — *exceeds* OLS, the canonical surprise. |
| First-stage F (`nearc4`) | **13.3** | Real but only moderately strong instrument; must be reported. |

A pipeline that handles IV correctly recovers a positive OLS return, an IV return
that **exceeds** it, and **reports the first-stage strength** instead of assuming
the instrument is strong.

## Task: `did-staggered-recovery`

A deterministic simulated panel with 60 units over 10 periods, two treated
cohorts, and never-treated controls. Untreated potential outcomes satisfy
parallel trends, but treatment effects are heterogeneous and grow with event
time, so plain TWFE is biased downward.

| Quantity | Value | Meaning |
|---|---:|---|
| True ATT on treated post observations | **2.909** | Recomputed from the shipped `y0` counterfactual column. |
| Plain TWFE coefficient | **1.455** | Biased downward under heterogeneous dynamic effects. |
| Group-time DID ATT | **2.909** | Uses not-yet-treated controls and recovers the true ATT. |
| Identifiable group-time cells | **11** | All post-treatment cells with valid not-yet-treated controls. |

A pipeline that handles staggered DID correctly reports TWFE as a diagnostic and
uses a group-time / not-yet-treated comparison as the main estimate.

## Task: `rdd-recovery`

A deterministic, noiseless sharp regression-discontinuity design: 101 points,
running variable `x` on `[-1, 1]`, cutoff at 0, sharp treatment `D = 1[x >= 0]`.
The untreated outcome is linear in `x` with *different slopes* on either side of
the cutoff, and treatment adds a constant jump. The data ships a `y0`
counterfactual column the estimators never read, so the true jump is recomputed
by the checker as `mean(y - y0)` over treated rows.

| Quantity | Value | Meaning |
|---|---:|---|
| True effect at the cutoff | **3.000** | The jump in the conditional mean at `x = 0`, by construction. |
| Naive across-cutoff mean difference | **5.510** | Confounds the jump with the running-variable trend — badly biased. |
| Global common-slope OLS (`y ~ 1 + D + x`) | **2.940** | A mild specification bias from forcing one slope on two. |
| Local-linear at the cutoff | **3.000** | Recovers the true jump; bandwidth-robust on exactly-linear sides. |

A pipeline that handles RD correctly recognizes the treatment effect is the
*jump* at the cutoff (not a difference in side means), so it controls for the
running-variable trend with a local-linear fit instead of comparing averages
across the threshold. The reference uses local linear rather than a global
high-order polynomial, following Gelman & Imbens (2019); see also Imbens &
Lemieux (2008) and Lee & Lemieux (2010).

## Task: `bad-control-recovery`

A deterministic, noiseless cross-section of 120 units. Treatment `d` is assigned
*orthogonally* to a pre-treatment covariate `x` (no omitted-variable
confounding), and a mediator `m` sits on the path `d -> m -> y`. The data ships
`y0`/`y1` potential-outcome columns the estimators never read, so the checker
recomputes the true total effect as `mean(y1 - y0)`.

| Quantity | Value | Meaning |
|---|---:|---|
| True total effect of `d` | **2.500** | `mean(y1 - y0)`, by construction (0.5 direct + 2.0 through `m`). |
| `y ~ d` (naive) | **2.500** | Unbiased here — treatment is unconfounded. |
| `y ~ d + x` (good control) | **2.500** | Adjusting for the pre-treatment covariate is harmless. |
| `y ~ d + x + m` (bad control) | **0.500** | Conditioning on the mediator collapses to the *direct* effect — biased. |

A pipeline that handles controls correctly recovers the total effect when
adjusting only for pre-treatment covariates, and recognizes that adding the
post-treatment mediator biases the estimate (it does not headline the 0.5 as the
treatment effect). This is the good/bad-controls lesson of Cinelli, Forney &
Pearl (2022) and Angrist & Pischke's *Mostly Harmless Econometrics*: the issue
is not that all post-treatment variables are bad, but that conditioning on a
descendant of the treatment changes the estimand.

## What makes the golds trustworthy

The checker **recomputes** the data-derived golds (imbalance count, the true
naive ATT, the true SMD table, the IV/TWFE coefficients, and the simulated
staggered-DID estimands) every run, then compares the candidate's reported
numbers against them. A candidate cannot pass by fabricating a clean balance
table or a flattering effect — the `honest-reported-numbers` gold cross-checks
reported values against the data or deterministic DGP. Only the experimental
LaLonde benchmark (~$1,794) is a literature constant, and its gold is marked
non-required and generously toleranced, because observational methods are
genuinely not guaranteed to nail it.

## Run it

```bash
# 1. Check committed reference candidates (pure-stdlib pipelines, one per task)
python3 benchmark/reference_pipeline.py --check

# 2. Validate task specs and committed reference candidate metadata
python3 benchmark/check_benchmark.py --lint

# 3. Grade all tasks against the golds
python3 benchmark/check_benchmark.py
#    -> lalonde-recovery 15/15, card-iv-recovery 14/14,
#       did-staggered-recovery 12/12, no required failures

# CI/reference gate: fail on required misses and optional-gold drift
python3 benchmark/check_benchmark.py --strict --fail-on-partial --fail-on-orphan-results

# 4. Regenerate committed references after intentional benchmark logic changes
python3 benchmark/reference_pipeline.py

# 5. Grade one task / a real agent run (drop its results.json in a candidate dir)
python3 benchmark/check_benchmark.py --task card-iv-recovery
python3 benchmark/check_benchmark.py --candidate <run-name>
```

Candidate directory names are single path segments under `benchmark/candidates/`
and must match `[A-Za-z0-9][A-Za-z0-9._-]*`; the checker rejects path separators
or absolute paths before opening `results.json`.

### Candidate `results.json` contract

The machine-readable schema is [`schema/candidate.schema.json`](schema/candidate.schema.json).
The Python checker remains authoritative because it also compares reported
numbers against recomputed data golds.

```json
{
  "task": "lalonde-recovery",
  "method": "OLS regression adjustment (full controls incl. re74, re75)",
  "n_treated": 185, "n_control": 429,
  "naive_att": -635.0,
  "adjusted_att": 1548.2,
  "balance": {"age": -0.242, "black": 1.668, "married": -0.719, "...": 0.0}
}
```

Any pipeline (the StatsPAI/Python/R/Stata skills, or an agent run) can emit this
shape; the checker is pipeline-agnostic. The top-level `"task"` field is
required and must match the benchmark task id being graded, so a stale
`results.json` from another task cannot accidentally pass. Reported estimates
and SMDs must be JSON numbers, not strings; malformed numeric fields are rejected
before scoring so type errors cannot masquerade as benchmark failures.
Strict gates also use `--fail-on-orphan-results` so ignored JSON scorecards left
behind by renamed or deleted tasks cannot be mistaken for current coverage.

## Anti-fabrication, demonstrated

Tampering with a candidate to claim perfect balance and a positive naive effect
fails four required golds, including the cross-check that recomputes from data:

```
[FAIL]* surfaces-imbalance        0 covariates with |SMD|>0.25 (need >= 3)
[FAIL]* naive-is-negative         naive_att = 2000.0 (want negative)
[FAIL]* adjusted-flips-positive   swing -452, need +1000 & positive
[FAIL]* honest-reported-numbers   naive_att 2000.0 vs true -635.0; SMD[black] 0.01 vs true 1.668
Score: 2/15
```

## Extending

Add a task by dropping a new `tasks/<id>.toml`, a `compute_truth` branch, and any
new gold-check handlers in `check_benchmark.py`. The checker validates task ids,
repo-relative data-file paths, gold ids, known check names, required fields, and
candidate task metadata before scoring. Keep `schema/task.schema.json` and
`schema/candidate.schema.json` in sync with any new task/check/result fields so
editors and reviewers see the same contract as the Python validator. Keep tasks
deterministic and small enough to run in CI without third-party packages.
