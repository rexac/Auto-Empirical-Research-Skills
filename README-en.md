**The empirical-research specialist's agent-skills distribution.** Not a marketing list — **1,072 skills vendored and cataloged** in this repo, wrapped in a **numeric benchmark, an eval harness, a security audit, and CI**, plus a curated map of **23,000+ skills across 119 repositories** in the wider ecosystem.

AERS is two things at once: (1) a small set of **first-party flagship skills** that run the full empirical pipeline — data cleaning → identification → estimation → robustness → tables/figures → submission-ready draft — and (2) a **curated, security-aware catalog** of the empirical-research skill ecosystem, organized by research-workflow stage. The differentiator is not the count; it is that the flagship behavior is **verified against known answers**, not asserted.

## What you actually get (the numbers, precisely)

Numbers in this README are kept honest and disambiguated. "Vendored" means the files live in this repo and are tracked in a generated catalog; "cataloged ecosystem" means curated links to external repositories.

| What it is | Count | Source of truth |
|---|---:|---|
| Skills **vendored into this repo** and cataloged | **1,072** | [`catalog/skills.json`](catalog/skills.json) |
| Vendored **collections** | **64** | [`catalog/skills.json`](catalog/skills.json) |
| **First-party flagship** full-pipeline skills (StatsPAI DSL + explicit Python/Stata/R) | **4** | [`skills/00*`](skills/) |
| Numeric **benchmark tasks** with gold values recomputed from data each run | **5** | [`benchmark/`](benchmark/) |
| Behavioral **eval scenarios / rubric items** | **17 / 95** | [`eval-harness/`](eval-harness/) |
| Security audit of the **original baseline** (collections / files) | **52 / 2,940+**, 52/52 CLEAN | [`SECURITY-SCAN-REPORT.md`](SECURITY-SCAN-REPORT.md) |
| Curated **map of the wider ecosystem** | **23,000+ skills / 119 repos** | this README · [`docs/SKILL_CATALOG.md`](docs/SKILL_CATALOG.md) |
| **Tools catalog** (`tools/`): causal/econometrics libraries, MCP servers, causal discovery, benchmark datasets | **200 tools / 5 categories** | [`tools/tools.json`](tools/tools.json) · [`tools/CATALOG.md`](tools/CATALOG.md) |

> The security audit covered the original **52-collection / 2,940-file baseline (52/52 CLEAN)**. Skills vendored after that baseline are tracked in [`catalog/provenance.json`](catalog/provenance.json), [`docs/LICENSE_AUDIT.md`](docs/LICENSE_AUDIT.md), and [`docs/SKILL_AUDIT.md`](docs/SKILL_AUDIT.md); run `make audit` before relying on them in high-trust contexts.

## Verify it yourself in 2 minutes

The most persuasive thing here is not a number — it is that the flagship pipeline's behavior is **checkable without an API key or paid model**. Just Python 3:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/brycewang-stanford/Auto-Empirical-Research-Skills.git
cd Auto-Empirical-Research-Skills
make check        # repo validation + unit tests + eval lint + numeric benchmark
```

The benchmark is the convincing part: it **recomputes the gold answer from the raw dataset on every run**, so a passing score cannot be faked by hard-coding a number. Out of the box it recovers:

- **LaLonde (1986) / Dehejia–Wahba (1999)** — the naive observational comparison gets the *wrong sign* (−$635); covariate adjustment flips it positive (≈ +$1,548) toward the experimental benchmark (≈ +$1,794).
- **Card (1995)** — IV return to schooling (0.131) *exceeds* OLS (0.075), with the first-stage F (13.3) reported rather than hidden.
- Plus staggered-DID (TWFE bias vs. group-time truth), sharp **RDD**, and a **bad-control / post-treatment-bias** trap.

A pipeline passes only if it **surfaces the trap, refuses to headline the misleading number, and matches the recomputed truth**. See [`benchmark/`](benchmark/) and the full trust overview in [`docs/TRUST.md`](docs/TRUST.md).

> 💡 **Want it hosted and end-to-end?** Skip the assembly — [**copaper.ai**](https://copaper.ai) runs the empirical pipeline for you, built alongside this catalog by the same Stanford methodology team.

## Why trust this — three layers

| Layer | Anchor | What it brings |
|---|---|---|
| 🏛️ **Academic lineage** | **[Stanford REAP / SCCEI](https://sccei.fsi.stanford.edu/reap)** — Stanford Center on China's Economy and Institutions | A research center with a sustained publication record in empirical-economics methodology and a deep tradition in applied causal inference. |
| 🔧 **Engineering delivery** | **[CoPaper.AI](https://copaper.ai)** — empirical-research AI assistant | Ships **20 econometric-methodology skills** (DID / IV / RDD / PSM / DML, …) behind a Supervisor + 4-sub-agent architecture, one-sentence triggers, automatic publication-ready output. |
| ⚙️ **Open-source engine** | **[StatsPAI](https://github.com/brycewang-stanford/StatsPAI)** — the causal-inference engine | **900+ functions · one `import statspai as sp` · JOSS in submission · MIT.** Every DID / IV / RD / SCM estimate CoPaper.AI produces is driven by StatsPAI, and this catalog is part of that ecosystem. |

---

## The flagship pipeline skills

Four parallel implementations of the **same 8-step empirical loop** — *data cleaning → variable construction → descriptives → diagnostics → estimation → robustness → mechanism/heterogeneity → publication-ready tables & figures* — plus the submission and de-AIGC stacks. Each uses **progressive disclosure**: a thin canonical-call spine in `SKILL.md`, with deep per-step reference manuals loaded only on demand. They coexist; pick by stack and use case.

| Skill | Stack | Best for |
|---|---|---|
| **[StatsPAI](skills/00-Full-empirical-analysis-skill_StatsPAI/SKILL.md)** 🔥 | Agent-native Python **DSL** — one `sp.causal(...)` runs the loop; 900+ functions, self-describing API, unified `CausalResult` | Whole-pipeline automation in one agent call when you trust the DSL |
| **[Full Empirical Analysis — Python](skills/00.1-Full-empirical-analysis-skill_Python/SKILL.md)** 📘 | **Explicit** stack: `pandas` · `statsmodels` · `linearmodels` · `pyfixest` · `rdrobust` · `econml` · `causalml` | Teaching, referee-level line-by-line audit, strict replication needing full control |
| **[Full Empirical Analysis — Stata](skills/00.2-Full-empirical-analysis-skill_Stata/SKILL.md)** 📊 | Community standard: `reghdfe` · `ivreg2` · `csdid` · `did_imputation` · `sdid` · `rdrobust` · `synth` · `psmatch2` · `boottest` · `esttab` | When a referee or co-author insists on a Stata replication pack (AER/QJE/JPE/ReStud style) |
| **[Full Empirical Analysis — R](skills/00.3-Full-empirical-analysis-skill_R/SKILL.md)** 📗 | Modern tidyverse: `fixest` · `did` · `synthdid` · `HonestDiD` · `rdrobust` · `grf` · `DoubleML` · `marginaleffects` · **Quarto** | Single-`.qmd` reproducibility reports rendered to PDF/HTML/Word in one command |
| **[AER-Skills](skills/50-brycewang-aer-skills/)** 📕 | 9 skills: topic routing → identification audit → robustness → intro → tables → replication → submission → R&R → orchestrator | Top-5 economics (AER / AER:Insights / AEJ) submission: *identification-first* — fragile design, no prose saves it |
| **[chinese-de-aigc](skills/48-copaper-ai-chinese-de-aigc/SKILL.md)** 🇨🇳 | 17-pattern Chinese AI-tell library, 5-step locate→diagnose→rewrite→score→review loop | Lowering AI-writing signal for CNKI / Wanfang / VIP / Turnitin-Chinese submissions |

> **Why a DSL *and* explicit ports?** Reach for StatsPAI when you trust the one-shot DSL; reach for 00.1/00.2/00.3 when you are teaching, auditing, or must swap every diagnostic by hand. AER-skills then takes a correct analysis to acceptance threshold — these solve *different* problems and compose.

## What makes this more than a 23K-skill dump

Public-skill counts are easy to inflate, and recent studies show large skill indexes are often redundant and occasionally unsafe. AERS competes on **verifiable quality**, not raw count. Every layer below runs locally via `make check` and in CI.

| Layer | What it catches | Where |
|---|---|---|
| **Numeric benchmark** | Reported numbers that don't match truth recomputed from real data — the naive-DID sign trap, weak-IV without first-stage F, TWFE bias under staggered timing, RDD trend confound, post-treatment bad controls | [`benchmark/`](benchmark/) · 5 tasks |
| **Eval harness** | Prose-level failures: weak-IV false reassurance, staggered-DID TWFE misuse, fabricated citations, unsafe `curl \| bash` setup, multiple-testing abuse, AER compliance gaps | [`eval-harness/`](eval-harness/) · 17 scenarios / 95 rubric items |
| **Security audit** | Pipe-to-shell, reverse shells, credential exfiltration, prompt injection across 13 risk categories — 6-phase, 40+ hook scripts reviewed by hand | [`SECURITY-SCAN-REPORT.md`](SECURITY-SCAN-REPORT.md) |
| **Provenance & license** | Unvendored sources, license risk, hygiene drift across all 1,072 cataloged skills | [`docs/LICENSE_AUDIT.md`](docs/LICENSE_AUDIT.md) · [`docs/SKILL_QUALITY.md`](docs/SKILL_QUALITY.md) |
| **CI & compatibility** | Catalog freshness, broken local links, GitHub Actions policy, Python 3.9 **and** 3.12 syntax floor | [`.github/workflows/`](.github/workflows/) · 6 workflows |

```bash
make catalog     # regenerate catalog, provenance, audit, enrichment
make validate    # freshness + link / frontmatter checks
make check       # full gate: validate + Python compile + unit tests + eval lint + benchmark
```

The trust surface is **necessary, not sufficient** — regex rubrics don't certify prose and a small benchmark doesn't cover every design. It is built to *fail fast on known high-cost mistakes*. Read the honest scope in [`docs/TRUST.md`](docs/TRUST.md) and [`docs/QUALITY_GATE.md`](docs/QUALITY_GATE.md).

### Comprehensive skill suites

> The pain point AERS exists to fix: ask an AI to "run a DID" and it gives the baseline regression and stops. "Parallel trends?" — it adds one. "Placebo?" — another. *Every time, like squeezing toothpaste.* A skill is a **methodology playbook for the agent**: it already knows a complete DID means parallel-trends → baseline → robustness battery → heterogeneity → mechanism, with a defined output at each step.

### Tools catalog (`tools/`) — automated empirical & causal-inference tools

> Unlike the skills above, [`tools/`](tools/) catalogs the **software and services an agent (or researcher) actually invokes** — structured, license- and maintenance-aware, and wired into `make validate`. Source of truth: [`tools/tools.json`](tools/tools.json); browsable list: [`tools/CATALOG.md`](tools/CATALOG.md).

**200 tools across 5 categories** (curated 2026-06):

- **Causal-inference / treatment-effect libraries (32)** — DoWhy · EconML · CausalML · DoubleML · CausalPy · causallib · grf · CATENets · TMLE family · Mendelian randomization …
- **Econometrics / quasi-experimental libraries (86)** — panel FE · DiD (incl. modern/staggered) · event study · RDD · IV · synthetic control/SDID · matching & weighting · sensitivity, across R/Python/Stata/Julia (fixest · did · HonestDiD · rdrobust · synthdid · reghdfe · csdid · sdid · pyfixest · linearmodels · FixedEffectModels.jl …).
- **MCP servers (48)** — stats execution (StatsPAI · stata-mcp · R/Jupyter MCP) + data access (FRED · World Bank · IMF · OECD · Eurostat · Census · BEA · BLS · SEC EDGAR · OpenAlex · Semantic Scholar · PubMed · Zotero · arXiv …).
- **Causal discovery / structure learning (25)** — causal-learn · Tetrad/py-tetrad · gCastle · CDT · tigramite (PCMCI) · LiNGAM · NOTEARS/DAGMA · pcalg · bnlearn · pgmpy …
- **Benchmarks & datasets (9)** — causaldata · IHDP/Twins · ACIC competition data · RealCause · JustCause · Tübingen cause-effect pairs · bnlearn network repository …

<details>
<summary><b>Multi-agent collaboration systems</b> — paper revision, autonomous research, data-science teams</summary>

Role separation beats a single agent because the reviewer is independent of the drafter — the same logic as peer review.

**Paper revision & writing:** copy-edit-master (3 sub-agents, Strunk & White / McCloskey rules) · introduction-writer (strategist → drafter → reviewer → reviser) · CoPaper.AI PaperAgent (Supervisor + 4 sub-agents).

## Security

The **original 52 skill collections / 2,940+ files** passed a systematic audit — **52/52 CLEAN, zero FLAGGED**: no malicious prompts, viruses, reverse shells, or prompt injection. Every "sensitive" hit verified as one of three legitimate categories: **defensive security rules**, **legitimate academic API calls** (arXiv / CrossRef / PubMed / FRED / World Bank / OECD / BLS), or **standard Claude Code workflow hooks** (all local file ops, zero network IO).

![Skills Security Scan Overview](images/security-scan/security-scan-01-总览.png)

Six-phase, defense-in-depth: automated grep across **13 risk categories** → 100% manual review of all **6 hook-bearing skills and their 40+ hook scripts** (no `Bash(*)` wildcards anywhere) → three parallel agent content audits → supplemental integrity checks (hidden Unicode, encoding anomalies, HTML injection, network imports).

> **Key insight:** largest ≠ riskiest. The biggest skills all passed; [17-DAAF](skills/17-DAAF-Contribution-Community-daaf/) actually sets the bar for security-conscious design (14 defensive hooks + 32 deny rules + active credential scanning).

Newer vendored additions are tracked in [`catalog/provenance.json`](catalog/provenance.json) and [`docs/SKILL_AUDIT.md`](docs/SKILL_AUDIT.md) — run `make audit`. Full report: [**SECURITY-SCAN-REPORT.md**](SECURITY-SCAN-REPORT.md).
