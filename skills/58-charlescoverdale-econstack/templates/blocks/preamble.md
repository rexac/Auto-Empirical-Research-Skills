<!-- preamble: update check -->
Before starting, run this silently. If it outputs UPDATE_AVAILABLE, tell the user:
"A new version of econstack is available. Run `cd ~/.claude/skills/econstack && git pull` to update."
Then continue with the skill normally.

```bash
~/.claude/skills/econstack/bin/econstack-update-check 2>/dev/null || true
```
