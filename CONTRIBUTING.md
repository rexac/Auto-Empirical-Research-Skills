# Contributing

We welcome contributions! Here's how you can help.

## How to Contribute

### Recommend a New Skill

1. Fork this repository
2. Add the Skill entry in the appropriate category document under `docs/`
3. Run the local quality gate:

```bash
make catalog
make validate
```

4. Submit a Pull Request

Each Skill entry should include:

- **Name**: Skill name
- **Source**: GitHub link or install source
- **Function**: One-line description of what it does
- **Workflow** (recommended): Step-by-step execution flow
- **Install** (recommended): Installation command
- **Use case** (recommended): What type of research it suits
- **License**: Upstream license and any restrictions
- **Local path**: Where the vendored skill lives under `skills/`

The generated files [`catalog/skills.json`](catalog/skills.json), [`docs/SKILL_CATALOG.md`](docs/SKILL_CATALOG.md), and [`docs/EVALS.md`](docs/EVALS.md) are rebuilt by `make catalog`; do not edit them manually.

If the contribution adds a new first-party flagship skill or changes a recommended flagship workflow, update [`evals/flagship-evals.json`](evals/flagship-evals.json) so reviewers have a regression prompt for the expected behavior.

### Fix Errors

If you find broken links, inaccurate descriptions, or outdated install instructions, please open an Issue or PR directly.

### Share Your Experience

If you used a Skill to complete empirical research, we'd love to hear about it in Issues. We may feature your case in the docs.

## Scope

This catalog lists **open-source, self-contained skills** that researchers can install and run independently. To keep every listed skill independently runnable and license-clean, we **do not include** skills whose core functionality depends on a commercial product or proprietary/paid API (e.g. tools that require an account or paid service to work).

This is not a quality judgment — such tools may be excellent. If a tool later ships a fully open, no-account, locally-runnable path (e.g. against open corpora), we're glad to revisit.

## Quality Gate

All pull requests should pass `make validate`. The check verifies required project files, local Markdown links, `SKILL.md` frontmatter, generated catalog freshness, provenance/audit freshness, and flagship eval docs. See [`docs/QUALITY_GATE.md`](docs/QUALITY_GATE.md) for details.
